# JGit-Flow

**Current Version: ??**

**Issue Tracker Has Moved To: [https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/MJF](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/browse/MJF)**

JGit-Flow is a JAVA implementation of Vincent Driessen's [branching model](http://nvie.com/git-model "original
blog post").

It is based on Vincent Driessen's excellent command line tool [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) and is built on top of [JGit](http://eclipse.org/jgit/)

Currently it is only implemented as a JAVA library, but we will soon be adding JGit command line integration.
